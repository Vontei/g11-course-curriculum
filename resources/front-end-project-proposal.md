# Front-end Project Proposal

## Objective

Create a proposal for an independent project that you will implement over about 3 days. The purpose of this proposal is simple - formulate your idea and articulate the requirements of your application.

You must obtain approval from an instructor based on your proposal before you can start the project. The purpose of this is to help identify and address areas/requirements that are underdeveloped as well as areas that are beyond the scope of a 3-day project. Think of this proposal as a high-level overview of your project.

Typically, projects fit under these categories:

1. A minimum viable product (MVP). Think about who this product is for and the problem that your product attempts to solve.
1. A technology experiment meant to demonstrate your mastery in a single or combination of technologies. For example, if you have an idea for using CSS3 transitions or canvas to show off something, well, cool, think about what features you'd like to demonstrate.

> This is a great opportunity to build something for your portfolio to show to potential employers!

**Your Proposal Must Include:**

1. A project description
1. A list of technologies that you plan to use
1. A well-defined and written-out feature list

## Project Requirements

### CSS Framework

You must use Bootstrap to save time with common layout and styling patterns.

### Interactivity

You must utilize DOM manipulation, adding/removing elements, event handlers, and/or animation via jQuery.

### Programming Paradigms

You must use use either an *Object-Oriented* or *Functional* programming paradigm. Do not use a *Procedural* approach.

### Separation of Concerns

You must separate the logic from your DOM manipulation code. In other words, keep your jQuery DOM code is a *dom.js* file and your JavaScript logic in a *utility.js* file.

### Clean Code

Your code must be commented and contain proper indentation.

## Examples

1. A Tetris Game, a blackjack game, a battleship game, etc.
1. A quiz to test your JavaScript knowledge
1. A food library, similar to the [Game Library](https://github.com/gSchool/g11-course-curriculum/tree/master/week05/05_exercises/js-game-library), to keep track of your daily caloric/nutrition intake
1. A documentation aggregator that allows developers to easily search through documentation.
1. A flash card style interview prep tool.
1. Ping-pong scoring system.
1. [Sudoku Solver](http://mherman.org/sudoku-solver/)
