# Week 4, Day 3

## Today's Goals

- Handle and respond to DOM events with jQuery.
  - describe the advantages that jQuery events have over raw DOM event handlers
  - write syntactically valid event handlers directly on jQuery objects $(..).click(fn)
  - write syntactically valid event handlers using `on` - `$(...).on(‘click’, fn)`
  - write syntactically valid delegated event handlers using “on” on parent elements - `$(...).on(‘click’, ‘child selector, fn)`
  - `describe what `this` is set to inside a jQuery event handler
  - write code that wraps `e.target` in a jQuery object
  - Explain what bubbling is and identify cases when it occurs.
  - Write code that prevents bubbling and defaults with `return false` in the handler.
