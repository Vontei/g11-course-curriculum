# Week 6, Day 1

## Today's Goals

Use jQuery AJAX methods to perform asynchronous HTTP requests and interact with APIs.

  - explain what AJAX stands for
  - write code that gets JSON and does something on success
  - write syntactically valid ajax calls using `$.ajax ` as well as the shortcut `get()` and `post()`
  - describe what is happening when $.ajax is invoked: that it takes an object as an argument, that it makes an HTTP request, that the `then` functions fire on a 200 response, that the error functions fire on non-2xx responses
  - write ajax calls that send form parameters from an object
  - write ajax calls that send the request body as JSON
  - Explain the XMLHTTPRequest same domain policy
  - Define API
  - Discuss how APIs are used to connect services across the web.
  - Define and describe JSON.
  - Explain the formatting rules for JSON. (strings, no trailing commas)
  - Use JSON.parse() to turn JSON into a javascript object.
  - Use jQuery AJAX methods to hit an api and use the returned JSON to populate information on an web page.
  - Bonus: explain the JSONP workaround to the same domain policy
  - Bonus: specify a jsonp callback parameter in an ajax request
