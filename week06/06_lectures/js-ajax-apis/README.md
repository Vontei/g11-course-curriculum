## Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to...

- explain what AJAX stands for
- write code that grabs JSON data from an API and does something with it
- write syntactically valid AJAX calls using the jQuery methond `$.ajax`
- describe what happens when `$.ajax` is invoked - that it takes an object as an argument, that it makes an HTTP request, that the `then` functions fire on a 200 response, that the error functions fire on non-2xx responses
- write AJAX calls that send form parameters from an object
- write AJAX calls that send the request body as JSON
- define API
- discuss how APIs are used to connect services across the web
- define and describe JSON
- Use `JSON.parse()` to turn JSON into a JavaScript object.
- Use jQuery AJAX methods to hit an API and use the returned JSON to populate information on an web page
- explain the XMLHTTPRequest same domain policy
- explain the JSONP workaround to the same domain policy
- specify a JSONP callback parameter in an ajax request
