/*
  Challenge:
  Create a Quote class that has two properties:
    - text
    - author
  The constructor should take the values in as
  parameters.
  Create an instance of the Quote class and store
  it in a variable. Then console.log the text and
  author values separately.
  BONUS: Define default parameters if none are passed.
