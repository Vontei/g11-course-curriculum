- Meet at Platte at 9am.
- I (Mike) am NOT attending any talks so I will be in the classroom most of the day. *If you are behind, I recommend getting caught up rather than attending talks.* Class is not mandatory; we will be reviewing OOP, jQuery, and Jasmine testing. We're moving on to new material next week, so if you don't attend class, you need to catch up on your own over the weekend.
